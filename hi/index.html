            <p>Microplastics are plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters. They can come from a variety of sources,
                including:

                Microbeads in personal care products
                , Breakdown of larger plastic items

            <h1> Acc To Data & Reports : </h1>
            <hr>
            <p><span> 1.World Health Organization (WHO) 2019 Report:</span> WHO found microplastic levels in drinking
                water ranging from 0 to 10,000 particles per liter. Most studies, however, showed much lower
                concentrations, typically in the range of a few particles per lite.
                <br>
                <span>2.European Union Joint Research Centre (JRC) 2024 Report:</span> conducted by the EU found
                microplastic concentrations in European drinking water generally below 0.6 particles per liter. This new
                methodology helps standardize data across EU countries, facilitating more accurate tracking.
                <br>
                <span>3.National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS):</span> NIEHS data shows that around
                83% of tap water samples globally contain microplastics. Their analysis indicates higher concentrations
                in countries with less advanced filtration systems.
                <br>
                <span>4. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP): </span> to UNEP, an estimated 15–51 trillion
                microplastic particles currently float in the oceans, with a significant percentage entering human water
                supplies, although exact numbers for drinking water vary based on filtration methods and regional
                pollution sources​.
                <br>
                <span>5. World Health Organization (WHO) Report:- </span> suggest Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai's water
                sources contain significant levels of microplastics, with concentrations reaching up to 72 particles per
                liter in some samples.

            <p>1. Gastrointestinal Inflammation: Physical irritation in the digestive system may arise from microplastic
                particles.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2. Cellular Toxicity: Some microplastics can damage or kill cells due to size or chemical coatings,
                potentially leading to tissue inflammation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>3. Endocrine Disruption: Certain plastics leach chemicals that disrupt hormone levels, impacting growth
                and reproductive health. </p>
            <br>
            <p>4. Accumulation of Toxins: Microplastics can act as carriers for pollutants like heavy metals and
                pesticides, which may accumulate and pose additional health risks over time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>5. Neurotoxicity: Chemicals like BPA in some plastics may impact brain function over long exposure
                periods.</p>

            <p>1.Personal Care Products: Many exfoliating scrubs, toothpaste, and facial cleansers contain microbeads
                that easily pass through wastewater treatment systems, entering rivers, lakes, and oceans.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2. Textile Fibers: Synthetic clothes shed tiny fibers during washing, contributing significant
                microplastic pollution in water.</p>
            <br>
            <p>3. Vehicle Tire Wear: Tires wear down over time, releasing microplastics that enter water systems through
                runoff.</p>
            <br>
            <p>4. Agricultural Plastic Use: Plastic mulch and coverings degrade, adding particles to soil and eventually
                water systems.</p>
            <br>
            <p>5. Paint Particles: Degraded paint on roads, buildings, and ships releases microplastics that often end
                up in water bodies.</p>

            <p>
                1. <span>Regulate Plastic Production and Ban Single-Use Plastics: </span> Governments should implement stricter policies to limit plastic production and phase out single-use plastics, encouraging industries to adopt sustainable alternatives.<br>
                2. <span>Improve Wastewater Treatment:  </span> Upgrading treatment plants to include advanced filtration can capture more microplastics before they reach natural water bodies, significantly reducing contamination levels. <br>
                3. <span>Promote Biodegradable and Eco-Friendly Materials: </span> Supporting research into and adoption of biodegradable materials can reduce reliance on conventional plastics and lower environmental impact.<br>
                4. <span>Consumer Awareness and Behavioral Changes: </span> Public awareness campaigns can help people reduce plastic use by promoting reusable products and proper waste disposal practices. <br>
                5. <span>Research and Development for Microplastic Filters: </span> Innovating affordable filters for residential and industrial use can help capture microplastics directly at the source before they enter broader ecosystems.<br>
                6. <span>Encourage Recycling and Circular Economy Practices: </span> Enhancing recycling infrastructure and supporting a circular economy can help ensure that plastics are reused or repurposed, reducing the amount of waste ending up in waterways. <br>
